# Google Play Mobile Applications Analysis

The global mobile application market size was valued at USD 154.05 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% from 2020 to 2027 [①]. MMA Capital, a newly established venture capital, decided to invest in the mobile application area considering its promising future. However, as a new fund, MMA capital doesn’t have sufficient money and resource to get in touch with those applications which already receive high expectations during the pre-launch phase. As a result, MMA capital prefers finding some little-known projects that might be able to achieve relatively high returns with a small cost. The MMA capital believes rating might be a good indicator to start and find what factors would influence the final rating of an application. After all, the number of installations might be related to more unstable factors such as marketing campaigns or advertisement, rating can reflect user's reaction to the application in a more objective way.
Before starting investing and reaching out to the possible projects, the CEO of MMA capital would like to know some basic information about the market and trying narrow down the target. Jingyu and Yingxin, as the junior analyst of MMA Capital, are assigned to conduct the primary research about it. To start, they find the data from the Google play store [②].
